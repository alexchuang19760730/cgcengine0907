// LLAMA_EXPERT_CACHE_L4_SKIP_LAYER0 used to test `getenv(...) != nullptr`, under which `"0"` is a
// NON-NULL pointer, i.e. writing `0` ENABLED the flag. run_server.sh's profile wrote
// `LLAMA_EXPERT_CACHE_L4_SKIP_LAYER0=0` with a comment saying "layer 0 goes back into the pool",
// and the 2026-09-09 quality fix was therefore inert while every cap_*.json and llama-bench env
// block recorded the intent rather than the behaviour. The three readers live in three files, so
// the fix is not three copies of a comparison -- it is one predicate that they all call and
// cannot drift apart again.
//
// Off: unset, empty, or a leading '0'. Anything else is on (so "1", "true", "yes" all work).

// This is a *layout-matching* knob, not a quality knob, and the two historical verdicts on it are
// both right because they were taken against different bases:
//   - `-ngl 30` (run_n30cache.sh): the base keeps blk.0's FFN on the CPU, so pooling blk.0 moves
//     layer 0 to Metal -> float divergence vs base. skip0=1 is the bit-identical setting. (§8.36)
//   - full offload (ALLOW_NGL=1, all layers on Metal): the base has blk.0 on Metal, so skip0=1
//     turns layer 0 into a full-weight CPU tensor read by a Metal graph -> 4/10 on the 15+27
//     probe. skip0=0 is the correct setting. (2026-09-09)
// Set it to match the base layout of the configuration you are running, and expect the numerics
// to move when you flip it: it changes the pooled-layer count (39 vs 40) and layer 0's FFN
// consumer path. Any M1/M2/M3 reference is only comparable to the same value.

// the GGUF file at the absolute file offset recorded by the L1 index (segment-aware addressing,
// byte-verified against gguf-py on qwen36 IQ2 + gemma4 IQ3).
//
// Lifecycle / threading model (mirrors the Swift hot pool + C streamer design):
//   - slots are created either synchronously (llama_expert_cache_ensure miss -> this thread preads)
//     or by the background thread (llama_expert_cache_prefetch -> queued, filled off the critical
//     path at low priority).
//   - a slot is marked loading/queued while being filled; ensure() on a loading slot waits on its
//     condition variable. fill() refuses to copy from a loading slot.
//   - eviction is global LRU (last_use tick); only non-loading, non-queued slots are evictable.
//     total_bytes is kept <= budget when possible (a single blob larger than the budget is allowed).
//
// Not yet supported: split (multi-file) GGUFs (init fails and returns NULL — the loader still
// records file_idx in the index for future use).
