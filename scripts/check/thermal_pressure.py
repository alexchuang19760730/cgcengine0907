"""Read the OS thermal pressure level, in band, next to whatever is being measured.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The decode baseline is not reproducible: the same arm, same settings,
same day produced 6.6 / 9.75 / 10.24 / 16.17 / 6.95 t/s -- a 2.4x spread (see
`.workbuddy/memory/2026-09-16.md` section U). Without a reading taken at the same moment,
that spread cannot be attributed, so any "Nx faster" claim about decode is unfalsifiable:
a 1.5x win and a thermal slump are the same observation.

WHY THIS INSTRUMENT. `com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel` is a notify(3) key the OS
publishes; it is the SAME key `powermetrics`' thermal sampler reads, it needs no root, and
it costs ~2 ms (measured: 12 calls in 0.02 s -- cheaper than the round trip to ask the
server, so it can go inside a per-round loop).

The scale, and the separation it gave on prefill (2026-09-16, request level, zero overlap):

    0 Nominal   1 Moderate   2 Heavy   3 Trapping   4 Sleeping

  * read 0 at launch  ->  6/6 runs >= 250 t/s   (253.42 - 271.64)
  * read 1 or 2       ->  0/21 runs >= 250 t/s  (104.88 - 211.65)

The criterion is the level AT LAUNCH, not over the whole run: one arm read 0 at launch,
drifted to 1 then 2 mid-run, and its three requests still came in at 257.41 / 253.42 / 262.64.
See `docs/PREFILL250_CONDITIONAL_DELIVERY_20260916.html` and lesson `eng-gate-0038`.

THE TRAP THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND (measured 2026-09-16, macOS on this box):

    $ notifyutil -g com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel        # the real key
    com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel 0                      # exit 0
    $ notifyutil -g com.apple.system.this.key.does.not.exist     # a key that is not there
    com.apple.system.this.key.does.not.exist 0                   # exit 0, same shape

`notifyutil -g` answers `0` -- and exits 0 -- for a key that DOES NOT EXIST. `-v` and `-q`
do not change that (verified). So neither the exit code nor the output shape separates
"present and Nominal" from "absent". A parser that trusts them reports `NOMINAL` on a
machine where the instrument is missing entirely, and that is the same failure family as a
silent zero: "we did not measure" wearing the costume of "we measured, and it was fine".

What this module does about it, and what it cannot:
  * It refuses any key it has not been verified against (`SUPPORTED_KEYS`) instead of
    inventing a reading -- this kills the typo class, which is the one it can kill.
  * It CANNOT detect a supported key being absent on some machine. On such a machine the
    reading would be a permanent `NOMINAL`. The mitigation is out of band and already exists
    in this project: the key's liveness was established by its measured response to load
    (0 at rest, 2 under sustained load, ~47 s to return to 0). **A permanently-0 series is
    the signature to be suspicious of**, and the way to test it is a load test, not a parser.
  * It never folds an unknown into a number: unreadable is `None` / `UNREADABLE`.

DELIBERATELY NOT A GATE. This module records; it does not refuse to run. Decode has no
measured level -> throughput mapping yet -- establishing one is the point of recording it
everywhere first. Do not start gating decode numbers on a level until the separation has
been measured the way the prefill separation was.
