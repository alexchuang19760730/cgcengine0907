"""One probe for "is this box actually free", shared by every script that launches a server.

Why this is one module
---------------------
A launch on this machine loads a 13 GB model plus up to 8 GiB of expert-cache pool onto 16 GB of
RAM. Started while another session's server is up, it over-commits and the numbers describe a
thrash regime -- measured spread on identical configs was 17% and 2.5x on a bad day. That is not a
small error: it is the difference between a finding and a coincidence.

It was previously handled in three different ways, or not at all:

  * `decode_window_harness.py` classified processes by EXECUTABLE and documented why (`pgrep -f`
    matched a parallel session's polling shell, whose command line merely *contains* a llama name).
  * `plain_match_window.py` called `_H.llama_pids()`, which the harness does not define, and the
    AttributeError silently dropped it onto a naive `pgrep -f` -- the exact probe the harness had
    already replaced, for the exact bug it documents.
  * Twenty-one other scripts that launch a server did neither.

So the decision lives here once, and `audit` makes it visible which launchers are gated.

A deliberate asymmetry
----------------------
`require_first()` gates only the FIRST launch in a process. A multi-arm run loads, measures and
tears down N servers in one session; re-checking "is the box free" before arm 2 would fail on the
page cache our own arm 1 just filled, i.e. the guard would over-block exactly the runs it exists to
make attributable. Later launches in the same process record the state instead of refusing it.

Usage
