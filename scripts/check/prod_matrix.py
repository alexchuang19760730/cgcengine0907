"""The single production-grade measurement entry point: every profile x the standard cells.

⚠ INTERNAL (2026-09-25 ruling): despite the original wording below, this is NOT the external entry
point. Use `harness.py bench` / `commit_bench.py`. This file only enumerates profiles x cells and
delegates to llama_bench_matrix, which enforces the §2.5 CELL contract. Numbers from a direct run
are 「口徑不明」 unless they match the test card; do not quote them in commits.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
On 2026-09-17 the question "what is our decode" had FOUR incompatible answers (llama-bench
10.78/10.91, `decode_bench` 12.36, the HTTP sweep 12.95, the MTP A/B 12.62) and "what is our
prefill" had TWO (the HTTP acceptance arm 278.56/261.17/275.01 at a 2873-token prompt, and
llama-bench `pp2048` 276.25/300.43). Nothing in the repo enumerated the profiles at all, so a
"consistency" claim had to be assembled by hand from five files -- which is how the numbers drifted
apart in the first place.

Two user rulings fixed the instrument (both 2026-09-17): `decode_bench` is retired, and
`llama-bench` is the only instrument of record for BOTH halves. This file makes the rest of that
decision mechanical:

  * the PROFILE LIST is not written here -- it is parsed out of `scripts/run_server.sh` (the
    authority, which refuses unknown profiles by name), so it cannot drift;
  * the ENV and the MODEL are not written here -- every cell calls `llama_bench_matrix.py`, which
    gets them from `run_server.sh CGC_DUMP_ENV=1`, so there is exactly one resolution path;
  * the THERMAL series is not re-implemented -- `thermal_pressure.Sampler`, which takes its first
    sample BEFORE the child exists (that is what makes `launch` mean "launched into");
  * only the CELL SHAPES and the REPORTING RULE live here, because those are the two things that
    were previously re-decided per measurement.

THE CELLS (one shape per launch -- see the trap below)
------------------------------------------------------
| cell              | -p   | -n  | -d  | -b/-ub | why                                            |
| decode            | 0    | 128 | 512 | 512    | the house decode standard; `-d 512` is the     |
|                   |      |     |     |        | warm platform (`--depths 0` is the coldest cell)|
| decode-up         | 0    | 128 | 512 | 2048   | same row at the UPSTREAM batch so it can be    |
|                   |      |     |     |        | put beside published numbers                    |
| prefill-house     | 2048 | 16  | 0   | profile| continuity with the recorded pp2048 captures  |
| prefill-up        | 512  | 128 | 0   | 2048   | exactly upstream's default shape -> `pp512`    |
| decode-spec       | 0    | 128 | 512 | 8      | MTP verify (`--spec-type draft-mtp`), M=2..4   |

Upstream's own defaults are `-p 512 -n 128 -d 0 -b 2048` (`tools/llama-bench/llama-bench.cpp`),
and its canonical output rows are `pp512 / tg128 / pp512 @ d512` (`tools/llama-bench/README.md`).
`decode` is literally upstream's `tg128 @ d512` row, run at this repo's batch.

THE REPORTING RULE (the whole point of a standard)
--------------------------------------------------
Subtracting rep 1, not the mean. llama-bench's tg warmup is ONE token (`llama-bench.cpp`), so rep 1
runs against an empty pool while reps 2..n run against a warm one. Measured example
(`Backup/phase_decomp/lb_depth_repro_20260916.json`, `prod25-stream`):
`samples_ts = [8.19, 9.96, 10.41]` -> `avg_ts` 9.52, platform 10.19 (**+7.0%**). So this file always
prints both, and marks the platform value as the one to quote. Every row also carries the model
filename and the build commit, because `tag` does NOT contain the model -- `--arm prefill250` and
`--arm prod25` resolve to the SAME file, and only an explicit `CGC_SERVER_MTP=0` swaps it.

THE TRAP THIS FILE ENFORCES
---------------------------
One shape per launch. `llama-bench` builds one context per (n_prompt, n_gen, n_depth) combination
but the model and the expert pool are shared, so `-p 512,2048` lets the second cell inherit the
first cell's warm pool. Every cell here is a separate process with its own `--workdir`.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not measure anything new, it does not build, and it does not decide anything. N>1 for
`--runs` turns it into a cross-launch spread test; `prefill_certifiability.py` remains the deeper
harness for that (it also records the per-launch memory state that the spread correlates with).

    # gates (`CGC_MM_BITIDENT`, and the proposed IQ4_XS-in-group-A).
    #
    # WHY NO EXISTING CELL CAN SEE THOSE GATES. `ggml_metal_op_mul_mat` needs `ne11` (== the graph's
    # M) in [2,8] to reach the small-batch family, `mul_mm` needs `ne11 > 8`, and `mul_mv` reads
    # every weight byte M times (`ggml-metal-device.cpp:848` `nr1 = 1`). So:
    #   * `decode` / `decode-up` are `-p 0` -> every matmul is M=1 -> not eligible at all;
    #   * `prefill-house` / `prefill-up` run the SLAB path, whose M is the UBATCH and is > 8 by
    #     construction (the slab is armed only when `!cgc_is_decode_graph(ubatch.n_tokens, ...)`,
    #     llama-context.cpp:6902) -> every matmul is mul_mm -> the gates are unreachable;
    #   * the pool path at M=8 is the only place they act. It is also the ~10 t/s regime, so this
    #     cell is inherently slow (~50 s per 512-token rep) -- that is where the knob lives, not a
    #     property of the cell.
    #
    # WHY `batch="8"` AND NOT `-b 512 -ub 8` (the cheap version). Tried it first: `-b 512` makes
    # llama-bench do ONE decode and `-ub 8` splits it into 64 M=8 ubatches. It does not work -- the
    # slab gate reads the UBATCH width, so `-ub 8` selects the decode graph (pool path) anyway, and
    # the `-b 512` then fights the engine clamp on a pool-only profile. Pinning `-b 8 -ub 8` makes
    # the declared batch EQUAL the effective batch, which is the property `compat()` protects.

    # [CGC 2026-09-18] The MTP-VERIFY cell -- the last row of the reachability table that no
    # existing cell can see. `decode` / `decode-up` are `-p 0` with no spec, so every matmul is
    # M=1 and the gates are not eligible; `prefill-m8` is M=8; the slab cells are M>8. The verify
    # batch is `1 + draft.size()` tokens (llama-bench.cpp:2570-2574), so at the server's
    # `--spec-draft-n-max 3` it is 4 -- and `ggml_metal_op_mul_mat` reaches the small-batch family
    # for ne11 in [2,8]. This is the only production shape at M=2..4.
    #
    # WHY `batch="8"`: the same reason as `prefill-m8`. It is the only width the engine honours on
    # a pool-only profile, and `compat()` refuses a cell whose batch is not the effective batch
    # instead of running it under a false label. The verify batch (<= 4) fits inside 8.
    #
    # WHY IT IS NOT FORWARDED FROM THE SERVER ARGV: all seven profiles carry

    # directly comparable with the plain `decode` cell. It is NOT a pure kernel number: one round
