"""Decode arm sweep: restart the server per arm, run decode_bench, harvest cache final stats.

Why a driver and not a shell loop: every arm needs the SAME request shape, the SAME pool
accounting read back, and the server has to be SIGINT'd (not SIGKILL'd) so the expert-cache
teardown prints `final stats` / `miss attribution` / `read shape`. Those three lines are the
only way to attribute decode time to (miss count) vs (per-miss IO latency) — and they are
exactly what is missing from every decode number quoted in the docs so far.

Arms are declared below. Each is a dict of extra env vars layered on the base profile.
The driver is resumable: rows accumulate into --json keyed by tag, so a partial sweep is
still useful and re-running skips nothing already recorded (unless --force).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check/decode_sweep.py --arms baseline,mtp-off,pool-4g --rounds 5
    python3 scripts/check/decode_sweep.py --report /tmp/decode_sweep.json

def build_fingerprint():
    """The exact binaries a row's numbers belong to, discovered by GLOB over every shared library
    the run loads (`libggml*.dylib`, `libllama*.dylib`) plus the server binary itself.

    Why every row needs it: a sweep row without a fingerprint cannot be compared to anything --
    not to another arm, and not to itself a day later after a rebuild. The emitter in
    agent_harness/engine_loop REFUSES a row without one, so recording it here is what makes a run
    quotable at all. Recorded per row rather than per file so a rebuild mid-sweep is visible
    instead of silently averaging two different binaries.

    [CGC 2026-09-15 measurement-hygiene fix] Until now this hashed a hand-picked THREE files:
    llama-server, libggml-metal and libllama. That list omits libggml-base, which is where
    ggml-backend.cpp lives -- i.e. the scheduler and the `CGC_OA_ASYNC` gate -- and it omits
    libggml-cpu, which is where the mul_mat_id crash signature of the 20:18 SIGSEGV lives
    (build/ggml/src/CMakeFiles/ggml-base.dir/ggml-backend.cpp.o proves the mapping against the
    CMake object layout, not by inference). Consequence, measured: the pair recorded at 21:34
    (the OA_ASYNC gate still read presence, so both "noasync" arms bit-copied their segmented
    counterparts) and the pair recorded at 21:41 (gate value-aware, p25-slotgpu-noasync =
    {ff68c5a2}) carried the SAME server/metal/llama triple -- two runs whose scheduler code
    differed, stamped comparable by the very tool whose rule is "compare only within one
    fingerprint". See lessons.jsonl eng-mh-0007.

    Two things this shape buys, beyond coverage:
      * keys are version-free (`libggml-base`, not `libggml-base.0.19.0`), so a version bump
        cannot silently degrade an entry to "missing" (which is what the old literal filenames
        would have done) nor silently re-point to a different file;
      * the KEY SET is itself the fingerprint's shape. Old rows carry 3 keys, new rows carry 8;
        a comparison that mixes them is flagged by the key set rather than by nobody noticing.
        Rows recorded before this change are therefore not comparable to rows after it on the
        libggml-base dimension -- which is exactly the fact this change exists to expose."""

#
#   * The `p25-*` arms and the block from `p25-mmap` down assume you passed `--profile prod25`.
#     Run them on the default and they test prod25-ish knobs on a prefill250 base (ctx 8192,
#     -b 5632, SLAB_CAP 256) -- a different experiment, not a wrong one, but not the recorded one.
#   * `spac-on` is degenerate on BOTH bases now: `prod25` has always pinned CGC_SPAC=1, and from
#     2026-09-16 `prefill250` pins it too (run_server.sh:335, the prefill/decode unification). For
#     a real SPAC A/B use `--profile prod25 --arms p25-nospac,baseline`, or the equivalently named

    # The two possibilities this arm was built to separate:
    #   one-layer arm already unstable -> the divergence is not in the mapping at all; the mere
    #                                     PRESENCE of the extra nodes (CONT + GET_ROWS + VIEW per
    #                                     layer) perturbs the graph/segment layout globally;
    #   one-layer arm bit-identical     -> the mapping is correct and the divergence appears at a
    #                                     specific layer, which the arm ladder then localizes.
    #
    # => the SECOND branch. l20 already adds 20 layers' worth of CONT+GET_ROWS+VIEW+table nodes
    #    (~80 nodes) and is still bit-identical AND stable, so "extra nodes perturb the layout

    # contiguous SUFFIX of the stack. The digest is monotone in the LEFTMOST served layer, and the
    # count of served layers moves together with it -- 20 served is identical, 22 served is not. So
    # the same table also fits "any arm serving >= 21 layers diverges", which is a threshold/resource
    # effect and needs a COMPLETELY different fix from a wrong mapping at one layer. A nested-arm

    # all 39 layers served and every S1 node present, and its pool counters match the anchor exactly
    # (misses 13040, file_reads 36360). So the 156 extra nodes are numerically inert, and no
    # served-layer-count threshold can be involved -- which also removes the ambiguity rung 2 could
    # not resolve, licensing the per-layer reading: min_il=20 identical and min_il=18 different pin
    # the fault to layer 18 or 19.
    #
    # The per-layer readback then killed the ids: p25-keepleaf-dbg prints gather-vs-leaf for every
    # captured layer, and for TOKEN 0 the two agree at EVERY layer, 6 samples each. (Token 1 differs
    # at every layer -- that is the padding row whose layout/n_tokens quirk is recorded in
    # eng-src-0005, and it is provably benign because min_il=20 carries 20 layers of it and is still
    # bit-identical.) Note the aggregate `same=` field reads 0 because it compares the whole vector;
    # the meaningful comparison is per token, which is why it has to be split by hand.
    #
    # So both explanations S1 was built around are dead. What remains between the real arm and the
    # control is the ABSENCE of the leaf node -- and the header comment on cache_slot_table_tensors
    # says that absence was never intended ("the leaf itself is still built when this is on: it is
    # simply not consumed"). p25-buildleaf measures exactly that documented design.

    # llama_context::graph_reserve. It never produced a digest, so it is NOT evidence about the
    # logits -- it is evidence about the allocator. With BUILD_LEAF set, `slots` is not expanded and
    # not consumed, so the S1 chain (table/cont/get_rows/view) is orphaned; `slot_table` survives
    # only because line ~2190 expands it unconditionally, which makes it a graph ROOT WITH NO
    # CONSUMER -- and the new `remap` leaf is a second one. The scheduler assigns no backend to a
    # root that nothing consumes and ggml-alloc then aborts on buffer_id = -1.

    # [CGC 2026-09-15 S1 timing] CGC_SERVER_OA_ASYNC=0 pair -- the ONE variable left after the
    # value-level explanations died.
    #
    # By 21:29 the ids were exonerated twice over and on the real arm, not on a control:
    #   * p25-slotgpu-dbg, CGC-S1: EQUIV-* = 2067 lines, mismatch=0 on every one. The published
    #     table equals slot_table_safe() for every selected expert, so the "publish clamps a
    #     non-resident expert to slot 0 while safe returns -1" drift the two functions were written
    #     to have is NOT happening here -- consistent with the CGC-SLOT-TABLE clamp counter staying
    #     at 0 lines in every S1 log of the day.
    #   * CGC-S1: POST (the gather, read after ggml_backend_sched_synchronize) vs CGC-S1: EXPECT-*
    #     (what the hook published for THIS step's ids): all 39 layers x all 6 sampled graph builds
    #     agree, in every row the probe prints. On the real arm. With no leaf anywhere.
    # Together with p25-keepleaf being bit-identical, that leaves no value difference at all between
    # the real arm and the control, which is only possible if the difference is WHEN the table write
    # lands relative to the segment that reads it.
    #
    # That is exactly the hazard llama-graph.cpp describes at the S2 comment: the segmented async
    # dispatcher (CGC_OA_ASYNC, prod25 = on) submits segment i+1 only after the hook of segment i
    # has written the leaf, and the drain exists BECAUSE the leaf is a host-written input. S1 moves
    # the mapping into a graph node; if the drain is keyed to the leaf rather than to the hook, S1
    # loses the ordering guarantee and the gather can read the table before the host wrote it.
    #
    # This pair is the test: OA_ASYNC=0 reverts to the non-segmented dispatcher, so the ordering
    # question disappears. Compare WITHIN the pair -- both arms must carry the same value of this
    # switch or the digests are not comparable (CONVENTIONS.md rule A5 is about length; this is the
    # same class of mistake with a build switch).
    #   slotgpu-noasync bit-identical to gputime-noasync -> the drain really was keyed to the leaf,
    #       and S1's fix is to make the dispatcher drain on the hook (or on the table) instead.
    #   slotgpu-noasync still different -> the ordering is not it either, and the remaining suspect
    #       is the ggml-alloc buffer assignment (which the now-dead BUILD_LEAF arm was meant to
    #       probe); the instrument for that is GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2 node-level GET_CAUSE, not another
    #       digest.
    #
    # FIRST RUN OF THIS PAIR WAS A NO-OP, and the reason is a gate bug now fixed at
    # ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp:1745. The segmented dispatch was selected with
    # `getenv("CGC_OA_ASYNC") != nullptr`, so CGC_OA_ASYNC=0 -- and an empty string, and every
    # profile run_server.sh emits -- selected the SEGMENTED branch. The two arms therefore re-ran
    # the segmented arms exactly: md5 sets {dc055e63} and {29ca694a, 672585db, b8c705cc}, pool
    # counters misses 13040 / 14296 and file_reads 36360 / 39948, all identical to the segmented
    # run. The gate is now value-aware (unset/empty/nonzero = segmented, "0" = off), which keeps
    # prod25's recorded digests reproducible because prod25 sets "1".
    #
    # So the ordering hypothesis is UNTESTED, not refuted. Any earlier row whose declared purpose
    # says "non-segmented" is a segmented row; see lesson eng-gate-0005.

    #          nor the anchor. So the ordering hypothesis is REFUTED (the arm is still wrong with
    #          the hazard removed) and, separately, the S1 answer DEPENDS on the dispatcher:
    #          segmented = 3 values across 3 rounds, non-segmented = 1 stable value.
    # That splits the failure into a non-deterministic part introduced by the segmented dispatch and
    # a deterministic part underneath it. This arm asks whether the extra nodes are still inert once

    #   keepleaf-noasync bit-identical to gputime-noasync -> the nodes are inert again, so the
    #       residual deterministic difference is the ABSENCE of the leaf node (allocator layout),
    #       and the instrument is GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=2 per-node GET_CAUSE.
    #   keepleaf-noasync different -> the S1 nodes are only inert under the segmented dispatcher,
    #       which would make the segmented path's bit-identity a coincidence of ordering and would
    #       move the suspect back onto the nodes themselves.
    # Throughput from this pair is not a candidate number: genuinely non-segmented costs ~10x
