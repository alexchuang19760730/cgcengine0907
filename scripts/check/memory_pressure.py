"""Sample the OS memory pressure (swap / free / wired pages) in band, next to a measurement,
and attribute a slow run to thermal vs swap.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A slow llama-bench arm is ambiguous: the same arm produced 11.90 t/s at
NOMINAL thermal with a cold launch, then 9.91 t/s under HEAVY thermal -- and separately a run
whose swap grew by GBs measured slower with no thermal story at all. Without a reading taken
at the same moment, "this arm is slower" cannot be attributed, so every A/B lives under a
permanent alibi: *thermal drift, or swap pressure, or a real regression* -- three causes with
one observable.

THE TWO INSTRUMENTS. `thermal_pressure.py` already samples the OS thermal level in the same
shape (background thread, launch reading before spawn, launch/worst/hist result). This module
samples the memory side with the same contract, so a harness can hold BOTH samplers over one
arm and get an attribution instead of a guess.

WHAT IT READS, AND THE TRAP IT IS BUILT AROUND:
  * `sysctl -n vm.swapusage`  -> `total = X.XXM used = Y.YYM free = Z.ZZM` -- macOS reports
    swap *used*, which accumulates and does not shrink on its own. A run that GROWS swap
    (end - start > threshold) is pushing anonymous pages out; that is the memory-pressure
    signature that matters, not the absolute level (a machine can sit at 3.2 GB used forever
    without any run being at fault).
  * `vm_stat` -> pages free / inactive / wired down. `Pages free` on macOS is chronically
    small (the system counts most free memory as inactive/compressible), so FREE ALONE IS NOT
    A PRESSURE SIGNAL -- it is wired growth + swap growth together that are. The module keeps
    both numbers but the attribution rule leans on swap growth and wired growth, not free.
  * `ps` count of llama processes -- how many engines are alive during the run (a neighbour
    server is a different attribution: "someone else holds the GPU/memory").

THE ATTRIBUTION RULE (documented, not magic):
    thermal worst >= HEAVY                       -> "thermal"
    swap growth > 512 MiB  OR  (swap used > 6144 MiB AND growth > 0)
                                                -> "swap"
    wired growth > 1024 MiB AND swap growth > 0 -> "swap"   (the L4 pattern: wired crowds out anonymous)
    llama_procs > 1                              -> "contention"  (a neighbour engine is the alibi)
    both of the first two                        -> "both"
    none of the above                            -> "none"   (environment other: CPU/IO, not measured here)

DELIBERATELY NOT A GATE. Like thermal_pressure.py, this records and attributes; it does not
refuse to run. The threshold numbers are first-pass and must be tuned against history (the
swap_log.tsv series is the calibration set) before any harness starts gating on them.
