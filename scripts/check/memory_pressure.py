"""Sample the OS memory pressure (swap / free / wired pages) in band, next to a measurement,
and attribute a slow run to thermal vs swap.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A slow llama-bench arm is ambiguous: the same arm produced 11.90 t/s at
NOMINAL thermal with a cold launch, then 9.91 t/s under HEAVY thermal -- and separately a run
whose swap grew by GBs measured slower with no thermal story at all. Without a reading taken
at the same moment, "this arm is slower" cannot be attributed, so every A/B lives under a
permanent alibi: *thermal drift, or swap pressure, or a real regression* -- three causes with
one observable.

THE TWO INSTRUMENTS. `thermal_pressure.py` already samples the OS thermal level in the same
shape (background thread, launch reading before spawn, launch/worst/hist result). This module
samples the memory side with the same contract, so a harness can hold BOTH samplers over one
arm and get an attribution instead of a guess.

WHAT IT READS, AND THE TRAP IT IS BUILT AROUND:
  * `sysctl -n vm.swapusage`  -> `total = X.XXM used = Y.YYM free = Z.ZZM` -- macOS reports
    swap *used*, which accumulates and does not shrink on its own. A run that GROWS swap
    (end - start > threshold) is pushing anonymous pages out; that is the memory-pressure
    signature that matters, not the absolute level (a machine can sit at 3.2 GB used forever
    without any run being at fault).
  * `vm_stat` -> pages free / inactive / wired down. `Pages free` on macOS is chronically
    small (the system counts most free memory as inactive/compressible), so FREE ALONE IS NOT
    A PRESSURE SIGNAL -- it is wired growth + swap growth together that are. The module keeps
    both numbers but the attribution rule leans on swap growth and wired growth, not free.
  * `ps` count of llama processes -- how many engines are alive during the run (a neighbour
    server is a different attribution: "someone else holds the GPU/memory").

THE ATTRIBUTION RULE (documented, not magic):
    thermal worst >= HEAVY                       -> "thermal"
    swap growth > 512 MiB  OR  (swap used > 6144 MiB AND growth > 0)
                                                -> "swap"
    wired growth > 1024 MiB AND swap growth > 0 -> "swap"   (the L4 pattern: wired crowds out anonymous)
    llama_procs > 1                              -> "contention"  (a neighbour engine is the alibi)
    both of the first two                        -> "both"
    none of the above                            -> "none"   (environment other: CPU/IO, not measured here)

DELIBERATELY NOT A GATE. Like thermal_pressure.py, this records and attributes; it does not
refuse to run.

CALIBRATED 2026-09-28 (`curve_gate`). The first-pass numbers above were never checked against
history, and `.workbuddy/memory/swap_log.tsv` cannot do it: it holds 5 rows of point-in-time stock
with no arm boundaries. The calibration set is the repo's own arm records (~2.3k JSON files
scanned, 127 arms carry a run-internal curve), grouped by cell, decode t/s vs peak run-internal
swap growth:

    cell prod-new (n=111)   growth 0-512 MiB   n=23   tg median 11.96 t/s
                            512-2048          n=45   tg median 11.54
                            2048-8192         n=41   tg median 10.64
                            >8192             n= 2   tg median  8.02
    cell delivery (n=15)    0-512             n= 5   tg median 11.38
                            512-2048          n= 5   tg median 10.44
                            2048-8192         n= 5   tg median  9.14

So `SWAP_GROWTH_MB = 512` sits at the KNEE of a monotone curve -- and it was used as a GATE for
one day. CALIBRATED AGAIN 2026-09-28 (`state_gate`), on a bigger slice of the same corpus (129
arms carry a curve AND a decode sample; 122 of them are in the one cell with n), because a
measurement on the cleanest box of that night was refused by it while the arm was valid in every
other respect (draft chain alive, 62/62 samples NOMINAL, single-rep launch):

  * growth is almost a function of the LAUNCH state: rho(growth, launch `pages_free`) = **-0.870**
    (free 66-1993 MiB -> growth median 3372; free 7323-10859 -> growth 342). A tight box has to
    evict; a roomy one does not. With a 13.6 GB model on a 16 GB machine that eviction is
    structural -- it is part of the arm's own load, not evidence of a neighbour's interference.
  * the SAME arm on the SAME box produced growth -32 / +11 / +202 / +312 / +983 / +1971 MiB in
    one day. A negative "growth" is decisive: the number is not a property of the arm.
  * the in-arm signal is real but only PARTLY about the arm: after a two-segment expectation
    `growth ~= max(226, 3914 - 0.4404*launch_free)` (breakpoint fitted on the 122-arm cell), the
    residual still ranks decode t/s (rho = -0.327). Residual <= 0 -> ~11.7 t/s; 250-1000 -> 10.60;
    > 1000 -> 10.12. A single straight line does NOT work: it predicts ~112 MiB at free 9191 where
    the corpus's roomiest quartile actually sits at 342, and it refused a launch whose growth was
    LOWER than the previous launch's purely because its box was roomier (measured 2026-09-28).
  * launch free ALONE is weak (rho(t/s, free) = +0.275) and in-arm `min_free` is useless: p10..p90
    is 14..50 MiB in every bucket, including the cleanest arms, because the box runs there as soon
    as a model plus expert cache is resident. That is why `FREE_FLOOR_MB` (the IN-ARM floor) stays
    None -- and why the free-side gate below is on the LAUNCH reading instead.
  * the wired bar was worse than uncalibrated, it pointed the wrong way: rho(t/s, wired growth) =
    **+0.230** and the >1024 MiB group is FASTER (median 11.70 vs 10.80).

THE GATE THAT CAME OUT OF THAT (two halves, both calibrated, both recorded in the artifact):

    state_gate   PRE-LAUNCH, enforced: launch `pages_free_mb` >= `STATE_FREE_FLOOR_MB` (5000 MiB).
                 Refuses BEFORE the arm is spawned -- a tight box costs a cleanup, not 44 s.
                 Sweep on the 122-arm cell: floor 5000 keeps 65/122 (median 11.84 t/s, p25 10.91);
                 the refused group is median 11.03, p25 9.82, p10 7.86.
                 Override: CGC_STATE_FREE_FLOOR_MB.
    curve_gate   POST-HOC, enforced: residual `growth - max(226, 3914 - 0.4404*free)` <= 500 MiB.
                 500 and not 250 because 250 is smaller than the box's own motion (free swings
                 660 MiB in 10 idle seconds) and the residual differences two single readings;
                 at 500 the kept median is 11.70 t/s and the refused median 10.51.
                 The ABSOLUTE `SWAP_GROWTH_MB` bar is now OPT-IN (`CGC_SWAP_BUDGET_MB=<N>` turns it
                 back on). As a default it demanded launch free >~ 8.5 GB -- on this box that means
                 an almost empty machine -- and because growth is 87% launch state, it was mostly
                 re-encoding "was the box roomy" while also charging the arm for its OWN footprint
                 (expert-cache size, batch), which differs between configs on an identical box.
                 The wired bar is demoted to evidence (see above).

WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: none of these numbers is a strong instrument (|rho| 0.27-0.41, one cell,
mixed configs inside it). The gate is a readiness check with teeth, not a t/s predictor -- and the
honest reason to prefer the launch half is that it is checkable BEFORE spending the measurement
and does not depend on what is being measured.

# ── run-internal budget: the GATE (as opposed to the launch-stock LABEL) ──────────────────────
#
# WHY THE STOCK IS ONLY A LABEL AND THE GROWTH IS A GATE: `_box_gate` demoted the swap STOCK to a
# label (2026-09-26) because stock cannot separate "8 GB of old swap + a quiet compressor" from
# "small swap + a busy compressor", and only the latter eats t/s. The measurement that demotion
# left open is the other half of the same question -- what THIS arm adds while it runs. That is
# unambiguous here, because the launch reading is taken before the child exists (`Sampler.start`)
# and the end reading after it is gone, and it is now calibrated against history (see the module
# docstring): growth above 512 MiB tracks a ~10-20% lower decode t/s, monotone across both cells.
# The IN-ARM free floor stays off: p10..p90 of min_free is 14..50 MiB in every growth bucket,
# cleanest arms included, so it cannot separate anything (see the docstring).
FREE_FLOOR_MB = None

# --- the LAUNCH-state floor (the gate that replaced the absolute growth bar) -----------------
# ENFORCED on `pages_available_mb` (free + inactive + speculative + purgeable): the amount the OS
# can hand over without swapping out someone else's anonymous pages.
#
# WHY NOT `pages_free`, WHICH IS WHAT THE CORPUS WAS CALIBRATED ON: measured 2026-09-28, right
# after a reboot, `pages_free` was 57-72 MiB on the CLEANEST state this box ever has (swap 0/0,
# 5.8-6.0 GiB available) -- macOS fills the free list with cache, so the strict free list is a
# cache statistic. A 5000 MiB floor on it refused a freshly booted box. So the corpus-calibrated
# `pages_free` band stays RECORDED AND PRINTED as a warning, and the enforced floor is on a
# quantity whose failure mode is the one we care about.
#
# The 4000 MiB figure is a PHYSICAL floor, not a t/s calibration and is recorded as such: below it
# the model's own 13.6 GB demand starts evicting other processes' anonymous pages. Override:
# CGC_STATE_AVAILABLE_FLOOR_MB.
STATE_AVAILABLE_FLOOR_MB = 4000.0
STATE_FREE_FLOOR_MB = 5000.0   # corpus band (n=122) -- WARNING ONLY, see above

# --- the residual form of the in-arm bar -----------------------------------------------------
# growth is 87% determined by the launch reading, so the absolute value ranks boxes, not arms.
# What is left after removing the fit IS about the arm -- but the fit has to be the right SHAPE.
#
# A single straight line does NOT fit: it predicts ~112 MiB at launch free 9191, while the corpus's
# roomiest quartile has a median growth of 342 -- because the arm's own cold resident set (model
# pages, expert cache, Metal buffers) puts a FLOOR under the eviction it causes no matter how roomy
# the box is. Measured 2026-09-28: a linear-fit residual refused one of two back-to-back launches
# whose absolute growth (550 MiB) was LOWER than the other's (670 MiB) purely because its box was
# roomier -- i.e. the linear version re-created the old defect at the other end of the range.
#
# So the expectation is two-segment (hockey stick), breakpoint fitted by grid search over SSE on the
# 122-arm cell: `expected = max(FLOOR, A + B*free)`.
GROWTH_FIT_A = 3914.0        # free < 8100 -> growth ≈ A + B*free
GROWTH_FIT_B = -0.4404
GROWTH_FIT_FLOOR = 226.0     # free >= 8100 -> growth ≈ 226 (constant; line crosses at free 8375)
# The residual bar is NOT enforced by default, and that is a measurement result, not a retreat.
# Its own budget (250, then 500 MiB) turned out to be smaller than the quantity's motion: the SAME
# arm on the SAME box in ONE hour produced run-internal growth of 550 / 670 / 1971 / 2801 / 2984 MiB,
# and the expectation's input (the launch free reading) itself moved 1.2 GB between the pre-flight
# steady reading and the in-arm sampler reading (0.44 GB of expected growth per GB of free). A bar
# that refuses by draw re-creates exactly the defect this file was rewritten to remove: an arm that
# passed liveness, thermal and contract gets thrown away for a number nobody can reproduce.
# So: recorded and printed as a WARNING always; enforced only when `CGC_GROWTH_RESIDUAL_MB=<N>` says
# so (calibrated values: 500 -> refused median 10.51 t/s vs kept 11.70; 1000 -> refused 10.12).

      * the STATE half (`state_gate`, on the launch reading) is the gate. It runs before the arm
        in the callers; here it is re-derived from the same reading so the artifact carries it too.
      * the RESIDUAL half is enforced: `growth - (A + B*launch_free) <= 250 MiB`. The absolute
        growth is NOT, by default: it is -0.870 correlated with launch free, so as a bar it mostly
        asked "was the box roomy" and charged the arm for its own footprint (a config with a
        bigger expert cache evicts more on an identical box). `CGC_SWAP_BUDGET_MB=<N>` arms it.
      * wired growth is recorded and NOT enforced: rho(t/s, wired growth) = **+0.230**, i.e. the
        group this bar used to refuse is faster (median 11.70 vs 10.80).
      * the in-arm min_free floor (`free_floor_mb`) also stays off -- 14..50 MiB in every bucket.

    FAIL-CLOSED ON UNREADABLE: a missing launch free reading makes the arm NOT usable. A gate that
    treats "could not measure" as "fine" is the same defect class as the log sink that swallowed
    the engine's reason -- and the number it would let through here is a t/s reading taken under
    unknown pressure.

    `waived` is a reason string: the arm stays usable but the reasons are NOT erased, because the
    waiver is a decision that belongs in the record next to the evidence.
