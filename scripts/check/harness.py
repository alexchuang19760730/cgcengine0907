"""One front door for every windowed measurement on this line. `show windows` first.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Four things on this line each reimplemented "wait until the box is free, then run":

  * `decode_window_harness.py` (defines the probes; lane runner + HTML report)
  * `m123_gate_window.py`      (wraps the M1/M2/M3 oracle gate)
  * `plain_match_window.py`    (wraps plain_match_ab)
  * `server_window.py cmd_wait` (the shared probe itself, with its own wait loop)

They do not agree with each other, and the disagreement is not cosmetic. A launch into a busy box
measures the neighbour: the measured spread on identical configs here is 17%, and 2.5x on a bad day.
That failure is invisible in the number it produces, so it has to be caught before the launch -- and
today whether it is caught depends on which wrapper you happened to pick.

This file does NOT replace those wrappers. It is the FRONT DOOR: one place that knows

  1. which tools need a quiet window at all (the registry),
  2. what the box says right now (one shared probe, asked once),
  3. whether that verdict can be trusted physically, not just by bookkeeping
     (`--certify` runs the throughput sentinel; thermal NOMINAL alone has certified boxes that were
     ~5x slow -- 2026-09-20),
  4. and where the evidence went (`harness_runs.jsonl`, appended per run).

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--------------------------------
It does not run a server itself and it does not redefine any probe. Everything it knows about the
box comes from `server_window` and `window_sentinel`, so this file cannot drift from them.

HONEST BOUNDARY ON PROVENANCE
-----------------------------
The provenance recorded here is what THIS process saw: the box state before the run started, and
after it returned. The child process runs in its own address space. If the child is one of the
gated tools it asks the same probe for itself and carries its own evidence; if it is not, this
record is a statement about the box around the run, NOT about the child's internals. The record
says which case it is (`child_gated`) rather than implying more than it measured.
