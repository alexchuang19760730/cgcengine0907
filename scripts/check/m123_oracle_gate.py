"""m123_oracle_gate.py -- the per-commit M1/M2/M3 quality gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`precommit_e2e_gate.sh` is an HTTP quality harness: it grades ANSWERS. It cannot see whether the
forward pass still computes the same numbers. This gate covers that gap. It launches a server
through `run_server.sh` (so the profile, the env allowlist and the load path are the production
ones -- not a hand-built argv that silently drifts), sends the SAME deterministic probe the
reference oracle was produced with, and compares the fresh logits dump against the reference.

THE THREE METRICS ARE NEVER MERGED
----------------------------------
`cgc_logits_oracle_compare.py` reports them separately on purpose:

  M1 numeric identity    same row_fnv1a64  -> bit-identical logits
  M2 decision agreement  same argmax_token -> the chosen token did not change
  M3 topk set agreement  same top-N id set -> the candidate set did not change

M1 same + M2 different   should be 0; anything else is a tie-break bug.
M1 different + M2 same   the trap cell: M1 is the only side that can say "there IS a difference",
                         and greedy decoding is chaotic, so a drift that has not yet flipped a
                         choice can flip on the next token. PASS/FAIL here follows
                         `oracle_gate()`'s rule: ok == (M1 rate == 1.0 AND M2 rate == 1.0), and
                         the 2x2 cross-tab is printed so one number is never quoted for both.

CONFIG COMPARABILITY (added 2026-09-15 -- this is the whole point of the current revision)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cache-ON reference is a *relative* invariance check, and a relative check is only meaningful
between two runs of the SAME numerics-determining configuration. This gate used to ignore that,
and the result was a whole afternoon of chasing a "FAIL" that was really a category error:

  * `ref_iq3_pool8gb_M2_6144.jsonl` (2026-09-15 01:14) was dumped while `CGC_MM_BITIDENT` was
    still ABSENT FROM THE LAUNCH ALLOWLIST (`run_server.sh` only started forwarding it on
    2026-09-15, see the comment on the `-- MTP` block). `CGC_MM_BITIDENT=1` is pillar 1 of the
    bit-identical trio and it changes the M<=8 mul_mat family; without it the SAME logical row
    yields ULP-different values depending on batch size (`ggml-metal-ops.cpp:2395`). A dump taken
    without it can therefore never be bit-identical to a dump taken with it -- measured: only
    `CGC_MM_BITIDENT=0` reproduces the reference's step-0 row hash `e2578ac0ff15b37e`; every other
    single-knob arm lands on `a6302fd4d0ced8c0`.
  * Under the current production configuration the engine is *deterministic*: four independent
    launches produce byte-identical dumps (9/9 rows, 0 mismatches). So the old reference was
    stale, not the engine.

So the gate now resolves the launch environment on BOTH sides via `run_server.sh CGC_DUMP_ENV=1`
(which prints the fully-resolved `CGCENV`/`ENV`/`ARG` and exits before exec -- one source of
truth, no hand-written copy to drift), diffs the numerics-determining subset, and:

  * same config        -> normal M1/M2/M3 verdict.
  * different config   -> prints the diff and exits 2 (INVALID COMPARISON), NOT 1. A cross-config
                          diff is not a regression and must never be reported as one.
  * no sidecar on ref  -> warns that comparability cannot be verified, then compares anyway.

`--write-ref PATH` re-baselines in one step: it copies the fresh dump to PATH and writes a
`PATH.cap` carrying the same resolved config, so the NEXT gate run can prove comparability.
Every gate run also writes its own `Backup/m123_oracle_gate/cap_<tag>.json` for the same reason.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check/m123_oracle_gate.py
  python3 scripts/check/m123_oracle_gate.py --profile prefill250 --env CGC_SPAC=1
  python3 scripts/check/m123_oracle_gate.py --write-ref Backup/knifeedge_matrix/ref_xxx.jsonl
  python3 scripts/check/m123_oracle_gate.py --allow-incomparable     # read a cross-config diff

Exit code: 0 = M1 and M2 both 1.0, 1 = any difference, 2 = harness error / not comparable.

# v3, dumped 2026-09-15 22:33. Its 9 rows are BYTE-IDENTICAL to v2 (md5
# d2f0b9a01fc5404ebb04dcf3583e133f for both), so this is not a re-baseline of the numerics -- it
# corrects what the sidecar RECORDS.
#
# v2's cap says `CGC_OA_ASYNC=0`, but v2 was dumped at 17:21 against the PRESENCE-based gate
# (`getenv("CGC_OA_ASYNC") != nullptr`), while `run_server.sh` unconditionally puts the variable
# into SERVER_ENV. So that `0` selected the SEGMENTED dispatcher exactly as `1` does; the recorded
# value never had behavioural meaning. When the 21:36 fix made the gate value-aware and the
# launcher default was restored to 1 (preserving the effective behaviour of every profile that
# does not set the knob -- see dec-20260915-2215), `prefill250` resolved to `1` and the gate began
# reporting INVALID COMPARISON (`ENV.CGC_OA_ASYNC: ref='0' now='1'`) on EVERY run, i.e. the
# comparability check itself had gone dark.
#
# The verdict was never in doubt, and the dump proves it independently: M1 was 9/9 bit-identical
# against v2. The non-segmented path lands on `ff68c5a2`, not on the anchor `dc055e63`, so two runs
# that both reproduce `dc055e63` are both on the segmented path no matter what their env string
# says. A missing/incomparable config stamp must not be allowed to veto a bit-identity that the
# logits themselves establish -- and equally, `--allow-incomparable` is not the fix, because it
# discards the check for every future run too.
#
# `prefill250` now PINS CGC_SERVER_OA_ASYNC=1 in run_server.sh (eng-gate-0006: the knob a profile
# fails to state is the knob that drifts). v2 is kept on disk for the historical record.
#
# v3 RETIRED 2026-09-16 by the skip0 value-semantics fix; v4 is the current reference
# (Backup/knifeedge_matrix/ref_iq3_pool8gb_M2_6144_bitident_v4_skip0off.jsonl).
#
# Read this before concluding anything from a v4-vs-v3 diff. The three readers of
# LLAMA_EXPERT_CACHE_L4_SKIP_LAYER0 used to test PRESENCE (`getenv(...) != nullptr`), so the
# profile's `=0` meant ON and v3 was dumped with layer 0 OUT of the pool (39 pooled layers, and
# `CGC-DECPROF layers=39` on all 19 steps of that era's log). The fix made the readers parse the
# VALUE, so the profile's `=0` now means OFF: layer 0 joins the pool, 40 pooled layers, +142
# resident slots and +152 MiB of pool.
#
#   * `LLAMA_EXPERT_CACHE_L4_SKIP_LAYER0=1` (the pre-fix behaviour, reachable via
#     `CGC_SERVER_SKIP0=1`) reproduces v3 BIT-IDENTICALLY: M1 9/9, M2 9/9, M3 9/9, full-row
#     fnv1a64 9/9. That is the evidence that v3 was dumped with skip0 ON and that the predicate
#     change is inert in every other dimension.
#   * The new default does NOT reproduce v3: M1 4/9, M2 9/9, M3 6/9, cross-tab
#     `{same/same: 4, diff/same: 5, diff/diff: 0}` -- drift, not divergence.
#
# ★ The trap this comment exists for: the *resolved env string is identical on both sides* ("0"
# before the fix and "0" after it). The comparability check above is a string diff, so it CANNOT
# detect a value-semantics change and will report a plain M1 FAIL against v3 -- a category error,
# not a regression. Unlike the CGC_OA_ASYNC round (where the string itself moved, so the gate
# raised INVALID COMPARISON on its own), this class of change only ever gets caught by a human
# re-baselining on purpose. If a future knob change is described as "same env, different meaning",
# write a new reference; do not re-read the old one.
#
# v5 (ref_iq3_pool8gb_M2_6144_bitident_v5_spac.jsonl), dumped 2026-09-16 19:12. `prefill250`
# pinned CGC_SPAC=1 + CGC_SPAC_ALPHA=0.75 to unify the prefill and decode arms (run_server.sh:286),
# so "--profile prefill250" gained two ENV keys the v4 cap does not carry, and the gate went dark
# exactly like the CGC_OA_ASYNC round: `ENV.CGC_SPAC: ref='<absent>' now='1'` plus the same for
# _ALPHA, on every run.
#
# This is a NOMINAL re-baseline, and the evidence is not "M1 was 9/9 when I looked" -- it is that
# v5's file is BYTE-IDENTICAL to v4's (md5 a0a0ca742ca94e843c54b39981742738 for both), so the
# oracle rows were not re-derived, merely re-stamped. It also makes SPAC's claim precise: it
# changes WHICH experts are resident (victim choice + prefetch target) and demonstrably not the
# numbers, on this 9-row probe at this pool geometry. If SPAC ever does move the numerics, the gate
# now fails on M1 against v5 -- which is where it should fail.
#
# Note what is deliberately NOT done: CGC_SPAC is not added to DIAGNOSTIC_KEYS. That set suppresses
# a key from the comparability stamp, so putting it there would make the .cap stop recording it --
# i.e. the next reader could not tell a SPAC-on baseline from a SPAC-off one. The SLOT_TABLE_GPU
# precedent does not transfer: that knob is an experiment whose whole claim is bit-identity, and it
# is not a production default.
# v6 (ref_iq3_pool8gb_M2_6144_bitident_v6_nbaware.jsonl), dumped 2026-09-17 13:45.
#
# This re-baseline is NOT nominal, unlike every earlier one: it records a FIX.
# `expert_cache_on_topk` used to snapshot the top-k with a LINEAR read of
# `ggml_argsort_top_k`'s output, a view whose `nb[1]` is `n_expert*4` rather than `n_expert_used*4`.
# For every T >= 2 step it therefore read ranks k..2k-1 of token 0's sorted row for token >= 1 --
# legal expert ids, silently the wrong token -- and that vector is what writes the remap leaf, so
# all prefill and all batch verify routed tokens >= 1 through another token's experts. The read is
# nb-aware now; `CGC_IDS_LINEAR_READ=1` restores the old one in place for A/B on one binary.
#
# Measured, new binary vs v5: M1 5/9, M2 6/9, M3 5/9. Row by row the 4 changed rows are
# (0,0,'DEF') plus (5,1)(5,2)(5,3) -- and (5,0) is UNCHANGED while (5,1..3) change, which is the
# defect's own signature: on a 4-token step, token 0 keeps its routing and tokens >= 1 do not.
# A fresh launch against v6 is M1/M2/M3 9/9, and the two runs that failed against v5 produced
# byte-identical hashes (so the reference was stale, not the runs).
#
# Consequence for older evidence: M1/M2 passing across pools before this date shows INVARIANCE
# only. Every arm and every pool size made the same mistake, so cross-pool agreement could not see
# it -- the 2026-09-14 "M1 117/117" belongs to that category and must not be quoted as "the
# numbers were right". Only a v6 comparison can support that claim.
#
# Not a diagnostic key, and deliberately so: CGC_IDS_LINEAR_READ stays in the comparability stamp,
# because a reference dumped with the old read must never compare clean against a fixed binary.

#
# Why this list is spelled this way (fixed 2026-09-26, measured on this box):
#   * it used to hash `libllama.0.0.279.dylib`, which is a STALE leftover in build/bin while
#     `libllama.0.dylib -> libllama.0.0.578.dylib` is what actually runs. So the digest recorded the
#     bytes of a file no process had loaded.
#   * it did not include `libllama-common.0.dylib` at all -- and `common/speculative.cpp` is compiled
#     INTO that dylib. The consequence was measured this same day: the pre-fix and the k_eff-fixed
#     engine produced summaries with IDENTICAL engine_digest (libllama.0.0.279=0cd5a628,
#     llama-server=054fb22f, ...), i.e. the one comparison the digest exists to make -- "is this the
#     same build?" -- was blind on the exact axis under test, and `m123_gate_window.digests_agree()`
#     would have certified two different engines as one.
#
# libllama-server-impl.dylib belongs here for the same reason as the rest: it is where the server's
# own logic lives, and `llama-server` is a ~50 KB launcher whose md5 does NOT move when that logic
# changes. Found by measurement on 2026-09-23: three runs with different server-context.cpp
# behaviour (6c/6e, four arms) all recorded llama-server=054fb22f04a01c5c, so the summaries could not
# have told them apart -- the exact failure mode this function's docstring describes.
# (Spelled without the audit module's filename on purpose -- and the same for the harness's: the
# shared window probe's audit decides "is this launcher gated?" by TEXT search for those names, so
# naming one here reports this file as newly gated and invites the ungated baseline to be lowered on
