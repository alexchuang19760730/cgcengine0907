"""The production profile, frozen: ONE command, BOTH axes, delivery conventions, NOMINAL-gated.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three things were true at once on 2026-09-20, and none of the existing tools
could hold them together:

  1. The delivery decode number (10.94 / 13.10 t/s, `Backup/phase_decomp/{warmskip2,carrier2}_*`)
     is NOT reproducible with `profile_duo.py` or `prod_matrix.py`. Those two run the `decode`
     cell, which carries no `--spec-type` and no `--warm-skip`, i.e. MTP off and a cold clock --
     the same profile then reads 7.96. So the profile's own reported decode axis understates its
     delivered decode by ~1.4x, and the better number only exists as a one-off command line
     recorded in a JSON blob.
  2. The recipe behind that better number is not a profile: it is the arm `prod25-stream`
     (`prod25` + `CGC_PREFILL_STREAM=1` + `CGC_GATHER_SLAB_CAP=256`) PLUS four bench-side
     conventions (`--batch 512`, `--ctx-size 4096`, `--warm-skip 64`, `--spec-type draft-mtp`).
     Nothing committed states that bundle, so "the best decode we have" lived in prose.
  3. The knob sets of `prefill250` and of that arm are IDENTICAL -- verified zero-GPU with
     `CGC_DUMP_ENV=1`: the resolved env diff is empty, and the only differences are
     `BATCH/UBATCH` (5632 vs the model default), `CTX` (8192 vs 4096) and the chat-template
     kwargs, all three of which the delivery decode cell overrides anyway. So the unified
     profile already exists; what was missing is a pinned record and an instrument.

This file is that instrument. It runs the two production axes and nothing else:

    prefill-house    --arms <profile>  --prompt 2048 --gen 16 --depths 0
                     (the shape behind the recorded 276.25 / 300.43; bar 250)
    decode-delivery  --arms <profile>  --prompt 0 --gen 128 --depths 512
                                       --batch 512 --ctx-size 4096
                                       --warm-skip 64 --spec-type draft-mtp
                     (the served shape: ctx 4096, MTP verify on, clock started after 64 tokens)

and, unless `--no-ref`, the SAME decode cell on the arm `prod25-stream`. That third launch is the
reproducibility anchor and it is the reason this tool is worth its runtime: a fresh number is
otherwise unanchored, because the decode axis is the one where the record already shows the same
arm reading 10.94 and 13.10 under the same NOMINAL label. If the profile and the anchor disagree,
the finding is "the delivery convention did not reproduce", not "the profile is faster/slower".

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not add a profile to `scripts/run_server.sh`. A new case branch
there would be a pure duplicate (see point 3 above) and it would silently lengthen every
`prod_matrix --profiles all` run on this box, including another session's. The profile is pinned
by its RESOLVED KNOBS in the JSON this tool writes, which is checkable and does not move.

THE GATE. Nothing launches unless (a) the OS thermal level is NOMINAL, re-read immediately before
the launch, and (b) usable memory is at or above `--min-usable-pct`. Both refusals are reported as
findings, not crashes, and a cell that leaves NOMINAL while running is marked `clean=false` and
`bar_ok=false` -- launching from NOMINAL is not sufficient, and on 2026-09-18 four arms that all
launched NOMINAL gave 10.80 / 10.34 / 8.92 / 8.58 in the order of how hot they got.

WINDOW CROSS-CHECK (added 2026-09-20). The gate above is bookkeeping: it checks that the box CLAIMS
to be fine. On 2026-09-20 18:1x a window passed all of it -- NOMINAL throughout, 54% usable, no other
session -- while running ~5x slow, and it silently corrupted two rounds of A/B. So this tool now also
checks the box PHYSICALLY: the prefill axis it already measures IS the sentinel shape (pp2048, the
same population as `window_sentinel_ref.json`), so its own prefill reading is compared against that
recorded band at zero extra GPU cost. A reading under the floor marks the whole table
`window=DEGRADED` in the JSON and prints a warning. The per-axis verdicts are deliberately NOT
changed -- a degraded window usually fails the bars on its own, and the cases this catches are the
relative comparisons people make FROM this table.

Exit code is 0 whenever the table was produced. A refused bar is a result.
