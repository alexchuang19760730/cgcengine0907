"""s1_ksweep.py -- what does verify token 2..4 cost on the one-shot-submit path?

WHY THIS ARM EXISTS
-------------------
The delivery cell (`prod-new`, MTP on) moves 3.117 tokens per step. The single-submit (S1) shape was
measured at worse than that: 1.72x the segmented arm, but on a pair whose I/O structures differed
(`file_reads` 82,293 vs 0) and with neither arm carrying a verify batch (no `--spec-type` in either
command line). So the one number that decides whether 25 t/s is reachable has never been taken:

    on the one-shot path, how much does verify token #2..#4 add to the step?

At the S1 pair's own 49.2 ms/token, 25 t/s needs only `mean_len` 1.23 (accept ~8%). If the marginal
verify token is cheap (the repo measured 7-8 ms/token when batching does amortise), the step for k=4
is ~73 ms and the shape delivers >40 t/s. If it is not amortised at all, the step is ~196 ms and the
shape delivers ~16. Same shape, 16..42 t/s, decided by this sweep.

THE ARM
-------
    S1 (CGC_SEG_BATCH + CGC_B_SCHEME + CGC_SLOT_TABLE_GPU) + MTP on + a FROZEN pool.
    "Frozen" is not a setting: with the SEG_BATCH path the per-layer hook never fires, so no demand
    fill ever runs and nothing is ever evicted. The smoke run proves the state is real:
        final stats: requests=2173 hits=2173 misses=0  file_reads=0  fill_wait_us=0  hit 100.0%
    (requests == slots x layers exactly: the per-expert demand path is never exercised.)

WHAT THIS ARM'S NUMBERS ARE, AND ARE NOT
----------------------------------------
 * ms/step is the object: MoE gather/matmul is dense over the gathered rows, so it does not depend on
   the expert bytes' VALUES. Timing is valid even though the values are not.
 * mean_len is NOT the delivery accept: experts outside the frozen set are never filled, so part of
   the routing contributes a zeroed slot. Report it as this arm's accept, not the product's.
 * The pool is 3072 MiB, chosen by `budget_preflight.py` as the largest legal one (model 13030 +
   3072 <= 16384). At 8 GiB the box is oversubscribed by 4838 MiB, which is the state in which this
   project has previously burned 50-minute runs on all-zero arms. Side effect: routable=53 ->
   decode width 6 instead of 8, which does not bind for k<=4 (T<=5).
 * Every launch is labelled with the STATE it was taken in -- thermal level and swap, from the two
   instruments this tree already owns (`thermal_pressure`, `memory_pressure`), held OVER the child so
   the reading is the state it launched into and the middle it spent hot. A launch with no readable
   reading is UNKNOWN, and the artifact is then not quotable: state is part of the provenance.
 * The same launch measures PREFILL and decode (`-p 2048 -n 128`): the sweep reports both, because
   the slab that serves prefill and the gathered path that serves decode share the pool.
