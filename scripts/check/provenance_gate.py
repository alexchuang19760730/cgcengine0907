"""Commit gate: a measurement product must be able to answer "was the box busy?".

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`server_window.py audit-products` measured the state of this repo's evidence on 2026-09-22: **893
measured objects across 514 products, and 3 of them carried a window block.** The other 890 cannot
answer the only question that decides whether a reading is a finding or a coincidence. In
`server_window`'s own words: a launch into a busy box measures the neighbour, the spread on identical
configs here was 17% and 2.5x on a bad day, and *the failure is invisible in the number itself*. So
it has to be caught in the file, at the moment the file enters the repo.

`target25_report.py` stamps engine digest + window into its own artifact. This gate is the other half
of that contract: it refuses to let the NEXT artifact in without them.

WHAT IT ENFORCES
----------------
For every tracked `*.json` that contains a measured object (`server_window.MEASURED_KEYS`):

  1. every measured object carries `window` with a `class`   -- the busy-box question is answerable
  2. the product carries an engine digest somewhere          -- the reading has a named binary

And for the machine-written reports in `docs/` whose producer is registered below:

  3. both halves of the pair enter the repository in the same commit -- a report staged without its
     sidecar is numbers whose evidence is elsewhere, and a sidecar staged without its report is
     evidence attached to nothing. The registry is checked for completeness against the tree, so a
     new producer cannot quietly write artifacts that nobody judges (`producers_writing_html_docs`).

Rule: **no NEW offender, and the offender count may not rise.** The pre-existing offenders are in
the baseline and are TOLERATED, because a gate that blocks hundreds of files on day one is a gate
somebody `--no-verify`s away, and then nothing is gated. Equal is fine, fewer is reported as
progress, and `--update` re-baselines deliberately -- a separate command, so it cannot happen by
accident inside a commit.

Keys are REPO-RELATIVE. The baseline ships with the repo and this repo has several worktrees
(`flashkv0516`, `flashkv-devserver`, `flashkv-autobuild`, ...); absolute keys would make every
offender look new from the second worktree onward.

WHAT IT REUSES, AND WHAT THAT COSTS
-----------------------------------
`server_window.audit_products` is imported: it is THE definition of "can this product answer the
busy-box question", and a second definition of one question is how this line has already shipped two
answers to "how much memory is free". The digest key names are duplicated from
`attribution_timeline.classify_product` (that function lives on another line and its list is not
importable) -- a NAMED coupling, recorded here so a change there is a known edit here.

HONEST BOUNDARIES
-----------------
- **JSON only.** A report's provenance belongs in its sidecar JSON; requiring the pair is the
  author's job, not a text match on HTML. An HTML artifact with no sidecar is invisible here.
- **Key matching**, inherited from `audit_products`: a product recording the same evidence under a
  different name counts as missing. A false positive costs a one-line fix; a false negative costs
  weeks, so the gate errs toward naming the file.
- **`git ls-files`, not a glob.** It judges what git is being asked to keep, so untracked scratch
  under `Backup/` cannot move the count.
- **A rename enters a new path**, so moving a legacy offender is judged like adding one. That is rule
  1 read literally rather than a special case: carry the evidence in the same commit, or leave the
  file out.
- It says nothing about whether a number is CORRECT -- only whether the file records the conditions
  it was taken under. Those are different claims, and only the second is cheap enough to check on
  every commit.

TWO MODES, BECAUSE THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------
`check --staged` is the COMMIT gate (`check_build_tracked.sh` 檢查 12). Every `*.json` this commit
ADDS or MODIFIES must carry both halves, or the commit is refused. It reads each blob **out of the
index, not the worktree** -- otherwise a file staged bare and then fixed in the worktree would pass
while the commit kept the bare one, which is the discipline 檢查 11 already applies to its baseline.
`check` is the repo-wide audit versus the baseline: the legacy offenders are tolerated there so the
gate could ship at all. The commit gate needs no baseline and no tolerance, which is why it also
works while the audit is red.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/check/provenance_gate.py check --staged   # the commit gate (0 pass / 1 block / 2 cannot judge)
    python3 scripts/check/provenance_gate.py check            # repo-wide audit vs the baseline
    python3 scripts/check/provenance_gate.py check --json
    python3 scripts/check/provenance_gate.py update           # re-baseline from a real scan
    python3 scripts/check/provenance_gate.py selftest

WHAT THE PAIRING RULE CANNOT SEE (named, not hidden)
---------------------------------------------------
- It judges `docs/` HTML artifacts **whose producer is registered**. A report written to another
  directory (`Backup/`, `/tmp`) or by a producer nobody registered is invisible -- the second half of
  that is why an unregistered producer in a commit is itself refused.
- Both members must be in the same commit, so a run whose HTML is byte-identical and whose sidecar
  changed (or the reverse) is also refused. That is the strict reading of "a pair moves together",
  and it is deliberate: a split pair is one nobody can check (`git add docs/X.*` stages both).
- A sidecar deleted in a commit that does not touch its report is not caught (`--diff-filter=ACMR`
  excludes deletions from the staged set).
