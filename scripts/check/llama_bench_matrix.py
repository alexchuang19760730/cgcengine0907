"""Production prefill/decode matrix, measured the way llama-bench measures -- pp/tg x depth.

⚠ INTERNAL DRIVER (2026-09-25 ruling): this is NOT an external entry point. The only production
entry points are `harness.py bench` (general measurement) and `commit_bench.py` (pre-commit).
Every command built here is checked against the test card's machine-readable CELL
(docs/PROD_NEW_TEST_CARD_*.md §2.5): a cell that does not match is refused (fail-closed). A number
obtained by running this file directly must NOT be quoted as "our prefill/decode" -- its provenance
is unverified unless it matches §2.5. Go through harness bench / commit_bench.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every decode number this project has quoted so far came from a bespoke harness
(`decode_bench.py` / `decode_sweep.py`) driving our own HTTP server with its own prompt and its own
timing extraction. That is fine for A/B within the project, but it is not comparable to anything
outside it, and it let a real regression hide: `prod25` measured 7.97 t/s on 09-15 while the 09-04
log showed the same machine at 27.71 t/s, and neither number could be checked against a standard.

`llama-bench` is the standard. Its shape is pp(n_prompt) x tg(n_gen) x depth(-d/--n-depth), where
`-d` is "how many tokens are already in the context when the measurement starts" -- exactly the
"different long-context" axis that a streaming-expert engine must be judged on, because the whole
design is about what happens to the working set as the context grows.

WHY IT USED TO OOM
------------------
`llama-bench` accepts `-expert-cache <bytes>` (verified in `--help`), and without it the model loads
with all 256 experts of all 40 MoE layers resident: 13.66 GiB against a Metal
recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize of 11.45 GiB on this M4/16GB -> `test_prompt: failed to decode prompt
batch, res = -3` (GPU OOM) on the first batch. Passing `-expert-cache 8589934592` makes the loader
adopt the 143-slot/layer L4 pool and the same smoke test passes.

WHY IT THEN ASSERTED
--------------------
With the pool active and `CGC_PREFILL_STREAM` unset, `llama-context.cpp:285` clamps
`cparams.n_batch` to `cgc_pool_max_tokens()` (8) because a wider batch would read the shrunk
per-layer expert tensors out of bounds. `-p 128` then aborts:
`GGML_ASSERT(n_tokens_all <= cparams.n_batch)`. llama-bench cannot set `n_batch` from outside, so
the harness must pass `-b 8 -ub 8` -- which is not a workaround, it is what the server itself does
for every prefill chunk in that configuration. The other arm is `CGC_PREFILL_STREAM=1`
(+ `CGC_GATHER_SLAB_CAP=256`), which lifts the clamp and routes wide prefill chunks through the
whole-layer slab path; that arm gets realistic `-b/-ub`.

ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH
-------------------
The env does NOT come from a list written here. It is whatever `run_server.sh` resolves for the
requested profile: we call it with `CGC_DUMP_ENV=1`, which prints the fully-resolved SERVER_ENV and
argv right before the exec (see the block above the launch line). The 25.17 -> 5 t/s regression was
configuration drift (CGC_OA_ASYNC 1->0, CGC_SPAC on->off, CGC_MM_BITIDENT dropped, two
bit-identical pillars 1->0), so a second hand-maintained copy of the env is exactly the failure mode
to avoid.

    # [2026-09-17] The phase-split A/B (M1 work items 2/3). Three arms, all on `prefill250` so that
    # pool / ctx / batch / MTP / template are identical and ONLY the phase decision can differ.
    #
    # Why the same profile for all three: `prefill250` is the only profile that arms the slab, so
    # "slab on" and "slab off" have to be expressed as an override of that same profile. Using two
    # different profiles would change a dozen things at once.
    #
    # Why this is a PREFILL experiment and cannot be run on decode: with the pool's routable
    # geometry here, `decode_width = min(floor(142/8), T_prefill-1) = 17`, and decode is T=1 (MTP
    # verify 2-4), so every decode step takes the DECODE graph in BOTH arms -- the whole-layer slab
    # cannot participate in decode at all. An armed-vs-unarmed comparison on decode is zero by
    # construction, and reporting that zero as "the slab has no benefit" would be a false negative
    # manufactured by the measurement shape.
    #
    # Why three arms and not two: for a chunk wider than the decode width, the unarmed arm ALSO
    # takes the n_batch clamp (the launcher prints `[arm] slab OFF ... with the n_batch clamp on`),
    # so "armed vs unarmed" differs in two things: slab-vs-pool AND one wide graph vs many narrow
    # ones. Arms B and C differ only in the clamp width (8 vs 17), which is the graph-count axis;
    # B/C at a fixed prompt is therefore the "is the gap just graph-evaluation count" control.
    #   A phase-slab    : slab armed, clamp lifted          -> 1 x width-2048 PREFILL graph
    #   B phase-pool8   : pool path, clamp = cap 8          -> ~256 x width-8 pool graphs
    #   C phase-pool17  : pool path, clamp = bound 17       -> ~121 x width-17 pool graphs
    # With `--prompt 17` arm C is a single pool-path graph, i.e. the pool baseline at MATCHED graph
    # count, which is what separates "the slab is faster" from "the clamp made it slower".

    # lifted -- and aborted on phase-pool8/phase-pool17). Only the slab arm is measurable at a wide
    # prompt through llama-bench. The full grid needs the SERVER path, which chunks internally the

# --- 串流子行程（量測中途被殺也要留下軌跡）------------------------------------------------------

# **驅動自己的記憶體**裡，只有子行程結束才輪得到寫檔（`run_arm` 是跑完之後才 `write_text`）。於是
# 當**驅動**被殺（終端逾時、Ctrl-C、外面那把刀）時，磁碟上一行都沒有 —— 交付 cell 的 `gen 128` ＋
# `CGC_MISS_MASK_DBG` 那四場就是這樣消失的，而「停在哪一行」正好是那四場唯一的問題。stderr 在 C
# 裡是無緩衝的，所以只要驅動**即時**寫，被殺掉的中途也有完整軌跡。這一個 helper 因此是三件事：
#   ① tee：每讀到一行就 append ＋ flush 到 live log（不是快取，是落地）；
#   ② 停滯看門狗：連續 `stall_watch_s` 沒有新行 ⇒ 記 marker ＋ `sample` 子行程堆疊。
#      「卡住」與「很慢」只能靠堆疊分，靠等分不出來；
#   ③ 自帶剎車：`arm_timeout_s` 逾時只殺**自己的 process group**（`start_new_session=True`），
#      驅動活下來把產物與 log 寫完 —— 讀數不該取決於外面那把刀幾點落下。
